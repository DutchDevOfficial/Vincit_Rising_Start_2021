# Vincit Rising Start 2021

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create an application that meets Scrooge’s needs.
You are free to use any technology of your choosing. The resulting application can be for example a web
page, an API backend, a mobile application, or anything else you deem suitable

## Application

A. How many days is the longest bearish (downward) trend within a given date range?


B. Which date within a given date range had the highest trading volume?


C. Scrooge has access to Gyro Gearloose’s newest invention, a time machine. Scrooge
wants to use the time machine to profit from bitcoin. The application should be able to tell
for a given date range, the best day for buying bitcoin, and the best day for selling the
bought bitcoin to maximize profits. If the price only decreases in the date range, your
output should indicate that one should not buy (nor sell) bitcoin on any of the days. You
don't have to consider any side effects of time travel or how Scrooge's massive purchases
would affect the price history.
